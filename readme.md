## Features
- Common symbols and punctuation available as combos on main layer, many duplicated on both sides.
- Home row mods on main layer (I don't really use them for typing, only for entering commands, modifier+mouse keys, modifiers+arrows, etc.)
- Symbol layer optimised for (La)TeX editing, with brackets and many common strings as inward rolls, e.g.; `<-`, `<=`, `->`, `>=`, `|->`, `:-`, `&=`, `[]`, `()`, `{}`, etc.
- Backslash on main thumb key on symbol layer.
- Rotary encoders:
  - Left: Volume controls by default, history scrubbing when symbol, equation or navigation layers are active. Press to overlay function keys.
  - Right: Window swapping by default, tab swapping when, equation or navigation layers are active. Press to overlay numpad on right side.
- Mouse emulation layer to reduce hand movement, same position as arrow keys on navigation layer. Scrolling underneath in vim layout.
- Media control layer on both hands.
- Combo to disable home row mods and other combos available.
- WPM counter, modifier states, and locking key states on master side OLED.
