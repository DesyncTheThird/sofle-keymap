# Desync's keymap for Sofle keyboard

Features:
- Common equation symbols available as combos on main layer.
- Home row mods on main layer.
- Capsword and select word functions implemented on main, navigation and editing layers.
- Symbol layer optimised for LaTeX editing, complements with my LaTeX macros setup.
- WPM counter, modifier states and locking key states on master side oled.
- Alternative layers available as comments in keymap.
- Includes rotary encoder support, left encoder is volume, right encoder is alt+tab.

Note: because I ripped the socket out of the left microcontroller, this keymap is currently set up to be flashed and run from the right microcontroller.
