Note: images are out of date but are mostly representative of the keymap.

## Features
- Common symbols and punctuation accessible through combos with many duplicated on both sides; combos trigger through most layers.
- Home row mods on main layer.
- Symbol layer optimised for (La)TeX editing, with brackets and many common strings as inward rolls, e.g.; `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `^{}`, `_{}`, `<-`, `<=`, `->`, `>=`, `|->`, `:-`, `&=`, etc. Backslash also on main thumb key on this layer.
- Number layer moves number row down to home row, with normal number row replaced with function keys.
- Rotary encoders:
  - Left: Volume controls by default, history scrubbing when symbol, equation or navigation layers are active. Press to overlay function keys.
  - Right: Window swapping by default, tab swapping when symbol, equation or navigation layers are active. Press to overlay numpad on right side.
- Mouse emulation layer to reduce moving hands about on table; same position as arrow keys on navigation layer, scrolling underneath in vim layout.
- Media control layer on left hand.
- Combo to disable home row mods available.
- WPM counter, modifier states, locking key states, and mute status on master side OLED.
